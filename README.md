# Joomla! X Clean Base Branch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joomla-projects/joomla-pythagoras.svg?branch=clean-base)](https://travis-ci.org/joomla-projects/joomla-pythagoras)

This branch contains the current development of Joomla! X (currently, X == 4),
based on a clean-base approach.

## Why Clean Base?

We honestly tried an incremental approach, i.e., to transform J!3 into J!4 using small steps.
The tight coupling and non-sufficient test coverage, however, makes it extremely hard to apply a state-of-the-art architecture.

It was suggested to start from a fresh ground, the clean base, to create the basic architecture,
and to port existing functionality in a second step.
The J!4 Architecture Team decided to try this approach.

## The "Chris Davenport Happy Milestone" (CDHM)

The team defined a milestone, named after the team member, Chris Davenport, who brought up the requirements.
You can see the original document here: [docs/j4cdhms.md](docs/j4cdhms.md).

The final decision is made, when the milestone is reached, or it shows out, that it can not be reached with the clean base approach.

## Installation

As there is no installer yet, a manual installation is required.
Check out this branch (`clean-base`), and run

```bash
$ composer install
